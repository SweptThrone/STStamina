# STStamina

### What is it?
STStamina is a simple stamina system for Garry's Mod.  Stamina falls when you run, jump, and swim, and rises when you rest.  Also comes with an energy pill entity.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the STStamina folder into your addons folder.  Configure it however you want and enjoy!

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, but please do not post reuploads on the workshop. I took a lot of time and sanity checking making this, and there's no reason to reupload it anyway. If you want a new feature or something, just let me know or make a pull or fork or something, I don't know how this works.
